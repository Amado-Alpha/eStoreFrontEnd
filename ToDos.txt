                       FRONT-END

1. Look into transition options for image slider (especially the projects showcase section)
2. Add formatting to the price column of the products (Amounts should be comma separated eg. 15,000)
3. Test validation for all forms.
4. Scroll triggered animations.
5. Add features and categories to admin panel.
6. Find a nice opacity to provide a shade for hero section carousel. cap: 1100 for all.

7. Error handling in the adding project part
   1. A user should be allowed to add a project without features and an error shouldn't be thrown out
8. Which is the best place to store your error handling logic.
9. Scroll triggered animations (ref. Tigo Tz official website)
10. Table pagination buttons should be visible only when the items > itemsPerPage
11. Making the footer to always stay on the bottom position regardless of the page content.

FINITO!!!

                        BACK-END
1. Check if the rule is enforced (Deleting a category should delete all the products in it).
   Add an additional warning " DELETING THIS CATEGORY MEANS THAT YOU'RE DELETING ALL THE PRODUCTS
   ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CATEGORY";





DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR FRONT-END (MY OWN OBSERVATION)
1. Use consitent font for all sections (Use a font that's well readable as well).
2. 

TO LEARN
1. Studying about image containers (How to style them accordingly).
2. The following is how sactum configuration looks like for local host, investigate how it should loo
   k like in a hosted site.

   'stateful' => explode(',', env('SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS', sprintf(
        '%s%s',
        'localhost,localhost:3000,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1:8000,::1',
        Sanctum::currentApplicationUrlWithPort()
    ))),

3. For the amount of time i have wasted trying to fight the sidebar, a tutorial on sidebars with vue a
   and tailwind is SOOOO important.
